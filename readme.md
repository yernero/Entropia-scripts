write me a program that takes in a material in entropia universe and asks me the information to find out the best price and amount combo to sell that material for based on a given markup value

Here's a simple Python script that could help you. However, please note that this is a rudimentary script and doesn't interact with the actual in-game API or market, as Entropia Universe's API (as of my last update in September 2021) doesn't support market interactions. So, this script would only be as accurate as the data you input.

Please replace 'your_material' with your actual material name.

This program will calculate the best price to sell a given material based on your desired markup percentage and the average market price for that material. It will also calculate the best quantity to sell, which in this case, it assumes you want to sell all of your inventory. Adjust as necessary for your needs.

This is a very basic script. For real-world application, you'd likely want to take into account more factors, such as varying market trends, competition, and more. Always cross-verify with current in-game market data and use your own discretion.
